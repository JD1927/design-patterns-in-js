/* # Motivation
- An object or system goes through changes
    - E.g., a bank account gets deposits and withdrawals
- There are different ways of navigating those changes
- One way is to record every change (Command pattern) and teach a command to 'undo' itself
- 
*/

/*
  Memento: Keep a memento of an object's state to return that state

  A token/handle representing the system state. Lets us roll back to the state when the token was generated. May or may not directly expose state information.

  Summary:
  - Mementos are used to roll back states arbitrarily
  - A memento is simple a token/handle class with (typically) no functions of its own
  - A memento is not required to expose directly the state(s) to which it reverts the system
  - Can be used to implement undo/redo
