/* # Motivation
- Want to augment an object with additional functionality
- Do not want to rewrite or alter existing code (OCP)
- Want to keep new functionality separate (SRP)
- Need to be able to interact with existing structures
- Two options: 
    - Inherit from required object (if possible)
    - Build a Decorator, which simply references the decorated object(s)
*/

/*
  Decorator: Adding behavior without altering the class itself

  Facilitates the addition of behaviors to individual objects without inheriting from them.

  Summary:
  - A decorator keeps the reference to the decorated object(s)
  - Adds utility fields and methods to augment the object's features
  - May or may not forward calls to the underlying object
