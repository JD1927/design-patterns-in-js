# SOLID Design Principles

Modern design patterns -> Uncle Bob

## Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have a primary single responsibility and as a consequence, it should only have one reason to change. That reason is being somehow related to its responsibility.

In other words, it's a bad idea to add more than one responsibility to a class

Group functionality by class.

*Note: anti-pattern the GOD Object*

Another term is **SoC -> Separation of Concerns**

## Open-Closed Principle
